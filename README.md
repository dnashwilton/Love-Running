On styles.css missed @media screen and (max-width: 950px) {}.

Added the above and moved #menu {
        clear: left;
        float: left;
        margin-left: 30px;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
        line-height: 25px;
    }

    into @media and (max-width: 950px) {}.

    Had trouble on W3C for css. I found an error in the css code so I corrected by copying the completed css code and pasting it into the css style sheet to correct it.
